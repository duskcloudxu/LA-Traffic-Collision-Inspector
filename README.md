# Los Angeles Traffic Collision Viewer

## Introduction

A web app based on dataset [“Los Angeles traffic collision data"](<https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-traffic-collision-data>)  with data sorting, filtering feature and some visualization.

## Developer Guide

### Naming Convention

- For CSS/Less document, use [BEM](<http://getbem.com/introduction/>) 
- For variables, use [little caramel-case](<http://wiki.c2.com/?LowerCamelCase>)
- For react components, use big caramel-case(Actually React require users use big caramel-case)

### Building Philosophy
1. Use [`React-Hook`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Npm Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
